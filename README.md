# Apartment-Reservation-System

In this project, I worked on writing Services, Controllers, Models and Repositories. I have also used Java Persistence API (JPA) Hibernate for writing queries in repositories to fetch data from database. I designed front-end user interface by using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. For database, I used MySQL and Xampp as my localhost server. 

Front-end: HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

Back-end: Java, JPA, Spring boot. 

Database: MySQL.
